# Graph Network Simulator

Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS) is a framework for developing generalizable, efficient, and accurate machine learning (ML)-based surrogate models for particulate and fluid systems using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNS code is a viable surrogate for numerical methods such as Material Point Method, Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and Computational Fluid dynamics. GNS exploits distributed data parallelism to achieve fast multi-GPU training. The GNS code can handle complex boundary conditions and multi-material interactions.  GNS is a viable surrogate for numerical models such as Material Point Method, Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and Computational Fluid dynamics.
